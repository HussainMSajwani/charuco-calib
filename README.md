# charuco-calib

Camera intrinsics from a video of a ChArUco board. Detects the board across the whole
clip, picks a well-spread subset of views, fits **both** a pinhole (Brown–Conrady) and a
fisheye (equidistant) model, and reports field of view with the caveats that actually
matter on wide lenses.

The reason it fits both: past roughly 120° the naive `2*atan(W/2/fx)` number from a
pinhole fit is wrong by tens of degrees. On one 4K clip the pinhole fit implies H 98.9°
while the fisheye model measures H 135.6° — and the pinhole distortion polynomial isn't
even invertible out as far as the image corners, so no amount of rectification recovers
them.

## The board

Generate one with the [calib.io pattern generator](https://calib.io/pages/camera-calibration-pattern-generator):

- **Target type:** ChArUco
- **Rows 8 × columns 11**, i.e. an 8×11 board
- **Checker size** and **marker size** — anything, as long as you know them. The defaults
  here are 8 mm / 6 mm; the larger boards used with `--square 0.015 --marker 0.011` are
  15 mm / 11 mm.
- **Dictionary:** 4×4 (50 markers) → `DICT_4X4_50`

Download the PDF and print it **at 100% scale** — no "fit to page", no margin scaling.
Then measure one printed square edge-to-edge with calipers and pass the real number to
`--square` / `--marker`, not the nominal one; consumer printers are routinely off by a
percent or two. Mount it on something rigid and flat (foam board, aluminium composite).
Any bow in the board shows up as distortion the fit will happily absorb. calib.io also
sells flat printed/anodised boards if the paper route isn't accurate enough.

Two things about how the board is constructed in code:

```python
board = cv2.aruco.CharucoBoard((11, 8), square, marker, dict_4x4_50)
board.setLegacyPattern(True)
```

It is `(squaresX=11, squaresY=8)` **with `setLegacyPattern(True)`** — that matches the
calib.io marker layout. The naive `(8, 11)` / non-legacy configuration detects almost
nothing, which looks exactly like a bad clip rather than a config error.

The physical square/marker sizes do not affect `K`/`D` at all; they only set the scale of
the extrinsics. The *ratio* between them does matter, because the detector uses it when
refining corners.

## Install

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Needs OpenCV ≥ 4.7 for the current `CharucoDetector` API (developed against 5.0).

## Run

```bash
venv/bin/python pipeline.py --video clip_1440p.mp4 --tag 1440p --square 0.008 --marker 0.006
```

Everything is keyed by `--tag`, so one tag carries through the whole toolchain.
A pass writes:

| file | contents |
|---|---|
| `detections_<tag>.npy` | per-frame corners, ids, sharpness (cached — reruns skip detection) |
| `frames_<tag>/` | JPEGs of every frame the board was found in |
| `coverage_<tag>.jpg` | where in the image plane corners were actually observed |
| `calib_pinhole_<tag>.npz`, `calib_fisheye_<tag>.npz` | `K`, `D`, `size` |
| `intrinsics_<tag>.json` | both models, FOV, validation stats, model-validity flags |

Useful flags: `--detect-only` (detection + coverage report, no fit), `--views` (maximum
number of views to select, default 500), `--nproc`, `--min-corners`,
`--min-frame-gap` (minimum separation in original source-frame numbers, default 12),
`--frame-stride`, `--no-save-frames`, and `--max-iterations`.

### Filming the clip

Almost every bad calibration traces back to the capture, not the fit. The board is only
a few hundred corners per frame, and the solver cannot invent constraints that were never
filmed. Four things matter, roughly in order:

**Keep the board in focus.** Check focus before you start recording, not after — on a
fixed-focus lens that means confirming the board is beyond the hyperfocal distance, and on
anything autofocusing it means locking focus so it can't hunt mid-clip. A soft board still
detects, so nothing warns you; the corners just land a fraction of a pixel off, and that
error goes straight into `D`. If the printed squares don't look crisp on playback, refilm.

**Move slowly.** Motion blur is the single biggest killer of corner accuracy, and it is
worst exactly where you need the data most — near the frame edges, where you tend to swing
the board fastest. Glide, don't sweep; pause for a beat at each position. The pipeline
scores every frame with a Laplacian-variance sharpness metric and discards the bottom 35%,
but that only picks the best of what you gave it. It cannot recover detail that was never
captured. Short exposure helps, so film bright.

**Cover as much of the frame as you can.** Get the board into all four corners and along
every edge, not just the comfortable centre region, and tilt it to a range of angles —
30–45° in both axes, not just fronto-parallel. Distortion is only constrained where there
is data, so an unvisited corner means the model is extrapolating there, and on a wide lens
that is precisely where distortion is strongest. A board that only ever appears flat and
central leaves focal length and the distortion terms fighting each other, and the fit can
diverge without ever looking wrong. Aim for a clip a few minutes long.

**Check the coverage image after every run.** `coverage_<tag>.jpg` is written before the
fit, and reading it takes five seconds. Dark regions are places the model is guessing.
The console report next to it gives edge/quadrant percentages and the distance from each
frame corner to the nearest observation — if those corner distances are large, refilm
rather than trusting the FOV number. Use `--detect-only` to get the coverage report without
waiting for the calibration.

### What a good result looks like

Aim for **calibration RMS below 0.8 px** on both models. Both numbers are printed at the
fit stage:

```
  pinhole  RMS 0.7106 px on 552 views (dropped 48)
  fisheye  RMS 0.5669 px on 552 views
```

Above ~1 px, don't reach for solver settings — go back to the capture. It is nearly always
blur or thin edge coverage, and both are cheaper to fix by refilming than to paper over.
Note that the separate validation RMS, measured over *every* detected frame rather than the
selected views, runs higher because it includes marginal frames the fit deliberately
excluded; the two aren't comparable, so hold the 0.8 px target against the calibration
number. Also check that pinhole and fisheye `fx` agree — the run warns if they don't — and
that the coverage report shows data near all four corners.

## Pipeline stages

1. **Detect** — `nproc` workers each take a contiguous slice of the video, run
   `CharucoDetector`, and record corners plus a Laplacian-variance sharpness score over
   the board ROI. Results merge into one cached `.npy`.
2. **Coverage report** — heatmap plus edge/quadrant/corner statistics. Distortion is only
   constrained where there is data, so this gates whether the FOV number is trustworthy at
   all. Read it before believing anything downstream.
3. **View selection** — deterministic greedy selection balancing a 32×18 corner-coverage
   grid with board centroid, apparent scale, roll, and board-normal tilt. Candidates are
   restricted to the requested corner count and the top 65% by sharpness, with a
   configurable source-frame spacing rule.
4. **Fit** — fisheye *first*, because it stays well conditioned at wide FOV even with
   coverage holes, then use its `K` to seed the pinhole fit. The pinhole fit releases
   parameters in stages (fixed principal point + `k1` only → tangential → `k3`) and runs
   two rounds with 92nd-percentile outlier rejection.
5. **Validate** — solvePnP against *every* detected frame, not just the ones used to fit,
   reporting RMS / mean / median / p95.
6. **FOV** — inverts the fisheye θ(r) numerically and measures the angle between edge rays.
   Also prints the centred convention and the naive pinhole number for comparison.

## Frame-selection procedure

The solver needs diversity in both *where* the board appears and *how* it is posed. Merely
moving a large fronto-parallel board around the image can cover the frame while leaving
focal length and distortion poorly separated. `select_views()` therefore uses the
following deterministic procedure.

### 1. Candidate quality gate

A detected frame is initially eligible when it has at least `--min-corners` interpolated
ChArUco corners and its board-ROI Laplacian variance is at or above the 35th percentile of
all detections. If fewer than 30 candidates survive, short-clip fallback relaxes the
corner requirement to `max(12, min_corners/2)` and removes the sharpness gate. This
fallback is recorded as `relaxed_quality_gate: true` and should not be mistaken for a
normal production-quality selection.

### 2. Calibration-free pose descriptors

For every candidate, a planar homography maps known ChArUco board coordinates to detected
image corners. It supplies a selection-only descriptor containing:

- normalized board centroid `(x/W, y/H)`;
- log convex-hull area, representing apparent board scale;
- roll as circular `sin(roll), cos(roll)` coordinates;
- the board normal's x/y components, estimated with a nominal camera matrix, representing
  perspective tilt in both axes.

These values are not passed to OpenCV's calibration and do not assume the final camera
intrinsics. They only distinguish visibly different views. Each descriptor dimension is
robustly normalized by its candidate-set 10th-to-90th-percentile span.

### 3. Combined spatial and pose-diversity score

Detected corners are also mapped into a 32×18 image grid. At each greedy step, every
available candidate receives:

```text
0.55 × spatial novelty
+ 0.35 × distance from the nearest already-selected pose descriptor
+ 0.10 × corner-count/sharpness quality
```

Spatial novelty is the mean current weight of the cells touched by that frame, with a
small square-root corner-count factor. After selection, weights of all touched cells are
multiplied by 0.55, so observations in unseen regions are favored without permanently
forbidding useful repeats. Pose novelty uses max-min selection: it favors the candidate
furthest from its nearest selected pose in centroid/scale/roll/tilt space.

Frames closer than `--min-frame-gap` source-frame numbers to a chosen frame are made
unavailable. The default is 12 source frames (0.2 seconds at 60 fps), regardless of
`--frame-stride`. `--views` is a maximum: the selector stops below it if the quality and
temporal constraints leave fewer independent candidates.

### 4. Reprojection-outlier replacement

The first staged pinhole solve measures per-view reprojection error. Frames above its 92nd
percentile are banned. Instead of simply deleting those frames—which could remove the only
edge or tilted observations—the diversity selector runs again over the full candidate
pool, requests the retained 92% count, and may replace them with other sharp, geometrically
different frames. Both final pinhole and fisheye models use this reselected set.

### 5. Auditable output

The console prints initial and final selected-set diagnostics: cell coverage; centroid,
scale, roll and tilt-normal spans; candidate count; sharpness threshold; and frame gap.
`intrinsics_<tag>.json` stores those values under `view_selection`, together with the final
source-frame indices and number of banned reprojection outliers.

This is still a selector, not a proof that the capture is sufficient. Descriptor spans are
relative to the available candidates, and the homography-derived tilt is approximate.
Always inspect the full-detection coverage report, compare subset fits, and refilm when an
edge, corner, scale, or strong tilt was never recorded.

### Selector tests

Synthetic tests exercise pose spread, hard source-frame spacing, and outlier exclusion:

```bash
venv/bin/python -m unittest -v test_view_selection.py
```

The selector was also regression-tested on two 1920×1080 IMX415 detection caches using
the 33/24 mm board. The stricter 12-frame separation intentionally retained fewer views:

| Dataset | Old/new final views | Old/new fisheye calibration RMS | Old/new all-detection RMS | FOV change | Principal-point change |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| wide, 200 requested | 184 / 164 | 0.992 / 1.043 px | 1.139 / 1.155 px | +0.516° H, +0.259° V | -3.24 px x, -0.00 px y |
| narrow combined, 300 requested | 276 / 134 | 0.889 / 0.968 px | 1.369 / 1.365 px | +0.302° H, +0.183° V | -6.41 px x, +4.53 px y |

Removing correlated near-neighbor frames raises calibration-set RMS, as expected, while
all-detection error remains within 0.02 px. The parameter movement is comparable to the
existing subset sensitivity and is precisely why the selected-frame diagnostics and
cross-subset comparisons must accompany any reported calibration.

### Guards worth knowing about

- **Divergence guard.** If pinhole `fx` and fisheye `fx` disagree by more than 15%, the run
  warns loudly. This is a real failure mode: seeding the pinhole cold on a clip missing the
  top of frame drove `fx` to 419 and produced a 23.9° angular residual that otherwise
  reported as a perfectly normal result.
- **Polynomial invertibility.** The run checks how far out in normalised radius the pinhole
  distortion polynomial stays monotonic and compares that to what the image corners need.
  `CORNERS OUTSIDE MODEL` means the pinhole model is undefined there.
- **Fisheye degeneracy.** `cv2.fisheye.calibrate` asserts on near-degenerate views, so the
  fit retries on progressively cleaner subsets (min corners 25 / 40 / 55) before giving up
  rather than killing the run.
- **Detector parameters are not resolution-scaled.** An earlier version scaled them by
  `round(W/1280)`. Measured at 4K that was strictly worse — 43.1 vs 47.6 mean corners per
  frame, 3 detection failures vs 0. Don't reintroduce it without rerunning
  `detector_test.py`.

## Analysis and verification tools

Each answers one specific question that came up while calibrating.

| script | question |
|---|---|
| `refine_all.py` | Refine intrinsics against **every** detected frame, not 500 views. Joint LM over 4000 views is a 24018² system and runs for days; poses are conditionally independent given the intrinsics, so it alternates pose-solve / Gauss–Newton on the 9 intrinsics instead. Same optimum, linear in frames. Writes `*_all.npz`. |
| `verify.py` | Coverage map, empirical θ(r) vs both models, undistorted sample frames. |
| `error_distribution.py` | Reprojection error magnitude *and* where in the frame it lands, pinhole vs fisheye. |
| `pp_uncertainty.py` | Is the principal-point offset real or fit noise? K interleaved folds calibrated independently; compare the spread to the measured offset. |
| `angle_consistency.py` | Do two calibrations describe the same optics? The angle between two 3D rays is rotation-invariant, so matched features across two clips must give the same angular separation through either calibration. A wrong focal length shows up as a fixed factor. |
| `fov_ratio.py` | Empirical FOV ratio between two capture modes from SIFT correspondences alone, no calibration involved — near the axis `r_b ≈ (f_b/f_a)·r_a`. |
| `fov_visual.py` | Remaps every mode into one shared equidistant projection so FOVs can be compared by eye regardless of where the camera was pointing. |
| `crop_experiment/crop_experiment.py` | Ground truth for the crop-factor argument: apply *known* centre crops to one video, calibrate each, check `fx' = s·fx` and `cx' = s·(cx - x0)`. |
| `detector_test.py` | Measures whether detector-parameter scaling helps at 4K. It doesn't. |
| `diag_detection_rate.py` | Splits a low-detection-rate clip into causes: marker detection vs ChArUco interpolation vs board-config mismatch. |

Scripts other than `pipeline.py` expect to run in the directory holding the `detections_*`
and `calib_*` artefacts, and several default to `--square 0.015 --marker 0.011` rather than
the 8 mm / 6 mm default in `pipeline.py` — pass them explicitly.
