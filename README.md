# charuco-calib

Camera intrinsics from a video of a ChArUco board. Detects the board across the whole
clip, picks a well-spread subset of views, fits **both** a pinhole (Brown–Conrady) and a
fisheye (equidistant) model, and reports field of view with the caveats that actually
matter on wide lenses.

The reason it fits both: past roughly 120° the naive `2*atan(W/2/fx)` number from a
pinhole fit is wrong by tens of degrees. On one 4K clip the pinhole fit implies H 98.9°
while the fisheye model measures H 135.6° — and the pinhole distortion polynomial isn't
even invertible out as far as the image corners, so no amount of rectification recovers
them.

## The board

Generate one with the [calib.io pattern generator](https://calib.io/pages/camera-calibration-pattern-generator):

- **Target type:** ChArUco
- **Rows 8 × columns 11**, i.e. an 8×11 board
- **Checker size** and **marker size** — anything, as long as you know them. The defaults
  here are 8 mm / 6 mm; the larger boards used with `--square 0.015 --marker 0.011` are
  15 mm / 11 mm.
- **Dictionary:** 4×4 (50 markers) → `DICT_4X4_50`

Download the PDF and print it **at 100% scale** — no "fit to page", no margin scaling.
Then measure one printed square edge-to-edge with calipers and pass the real number to
`--square` / `--marker`, not the nominal one; consumer printers are routinely off by a
percent or two. Mount it on something rigid and flat (foam board, aluminium composite).
Any bow in the board shows up as distortion the fit will happily absorb. calib.io also
sells flat printed/anodised boards if the paper route isn't accurate enough.

Two things about how the board is constructed in code:

```python
board = cv2.aruco.CharucoBoard((11, 8), square, marker, dict_4x4_50)
board.setLegacyPattern(True)
```

It is `(squaresX=11, squaresY=8)` **with `setLegacyPattern(True)`** — that matches the
calib.io marker layout. The naive `(8, 11)` / non-legacy configuration detects almost
nothing, which looks exactly like a bad clip rather than a config error.

The physical square/marker sizes do not affect `K`/`D` at all; they only set the scale of
the extrinsics. The *ratio* between them does matter, because the detector uses it when
refining corners.

## Install

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Needs OpenCV ≥ 4.7 for the current `CharucoDetector` API (developed against 5.0).

## Run

```bash
venv/bin/python pipeline.py --video clip_1440p.mp4 --tag 1440p --square 0.008 --marker 0.006
```

Everything is keyed by `--tag`, so one tag carries through the whole toolchain.
A pass writes:

| file | contents |
|---|---|
| `detections_<tag>.npy` | per-frame corners, ids, sharpness (cached — reruns skip detection) |
| `frames_<tag>/` | JPEGs of every frame the board was found in |
| `coverage_<tag>.jpg` | where in the image plane corners were actually observed |
| `calib_pinhole_<tag>.npz`, `calib_fisheye_<tag>.npz` | `K`, `D`, `size` |
| `intrinsics_<tag>.json` | both models, FOV, validation stats, model-validity flags |

Useful flags: `--detect-only` (detection + coverage report, no fit), `--views` (how many
views to select, default 500), `--nproc`, `--min-corners`.

### Filming the clip

Move the board slowly through the whole frame, including the corners, and tilt it to a
range of angles — a board that only ever appears fronto-parallel near the centre leaves
both the focal length and the distortion terms poorly constrained. Keep the exposure short
enough that the board isn't smeared; the pipeline scores sharpness and throws away the
bottom 35%, but it can't recover detail that was never captured.

## Pipeline stages

1. **Detect** — `nproc` workers each take a contiguous slice of the video, run
   `CharucoDetector`, and record corners plus a Laplacian-variance sharpness score over
   the board ROI. Results merge into one cached `.npy`.
2. **Coverage report** — heatmap plus edge/quadrant/corner statistics. Distortion is only
   constrained where there is data, so this gates whether the FOV number is trustworthy at
   all. Read it before believing anything downstream.
3. **View selection** — greedy max-coverage over a 32×18 image grid, restricted to frames
   above the 35th sharpness percentile, with a ±3-frame spacing rule so near-duplicate
   frames can't stack.
4. **Fit** — fisheye *first*, because it stays well conditioned at wide FOV even with
   coverage holes, then use its `K` to seed the pinhole fit. The pinhole fit releases
   parameters in stages (fixed principal point + `k1` only → tangential → `k3`) and runs
   two rounds with 92nd-percentile outlier rejection.
5. **Validate** — solvePnP against *every* detected frame, not just the ones used to fit,
   reporting RMS / mean / median / p95.
6. **FOV** — inverts the fisheye θ(r) numerically and measures the angle between edge rays.
   Also prints the centred convention and the naive pinhole number for comparison.

### Guards worth knowing about

- **Divergence guard.** If pinhole `fx` and fisheye `fx` disagree by more than 15%, the run
  warns loudly. This is a real failure mode: seeding the pinhole cold on a clip missing the
  top of frame drove `fx` to 419 and produced a 23.9° angular residual that otherwise
  reported as a perfectly normal result.
- **Polynomial invertibility.** The run checks how far out in normalised radius the pinhole
  distortion polynomial stays monotonic and compares that to what the image corners need.
  `CORNERS OUTSIDE MODEL` means the pinhole model is undefined there.
- **Fisheye degeneracy.** `cv2.fisheye.calibrate` asserts on near-degenerate views, so the
  fit retries on progressively cleaner subsets (min corners 25 / 40 / 55) before giving up
  rather than killing the run.
- **Detector parameters are not resolution-scaled.** An earlier version scaled them by
  `round(W/1280)`. Measured at 4K that was strictly worse — 43.1 vs 47.6 mean corners per
  frame, 3 detection failures vs 0. Don't reintroduce it without rerunning
  `detector_test.py`.

## Analysis and verification tools

Each answers one specific question that came up while calibrating.

| script | question |
|---|---|
| `refine_all.py` | Refine intrinsics against **every** detected frame, not 500 views. Joint LM over 4000 views is a 24018² system and runs for days; poses are conditionally independent given the intrinsics, so it alternates pose-solve / Gauss–Newton on the 9 intrinsics instead. Same optimum, linear in frames. Writes `*_all.npz`. |
| `verify.py` | Coverage map, empirical θ(r) vs both models, undistorted sample frames. |
| `error_distribution.py` | Reprojection error magnitude *and* where in the frame it lands, pinhole vs fisheye. |
| `pp_uncertainty.py` | Is the principal-point offset real or fit noise? K interleaved folds calibrated independently; compare the spread to the measured offset. |
| `angle_consistency.py` | Do two calibrations describe the same optics? The angle between two 3D rays is rotation-invariant, so matched features across two clips must give the same angular separation through either calibration. A wrong focal length shows up as a fixed factor. |
| `fov_ratio.py` | Empirical FOV ratio between two capture modes from SIFT correspondences alone, no calibration involved — near the axis `r_b ≈ (f_b/f_a)·r_a`. |
| `fov_visual.py` | Remaps every mode into one shared equidistant projection so FOVs can be compared by eye regardless of where the camera was pointing. |
| `crop_experiment/crop_experiment.py` | Ground truth for the crop-factor argument: apply *known* centre crops to one video, calibrate each, check `fx' = s·fx` and `cx' = s·(cx - x0)`. |
| `detector_test.py` | Measures whether detector-parameter scaling helps at 4K. It doesn't. |
| `diag_detection_rate.py` | Splits a low-detection-rate clip into causes: marker detection vs ChArUco interpolation vs board-config mismatch. |

Scripts other than `pipeline.py` expect to run in the directory holding the `detections_*`
and `calib_*` artefacts, and several default to `--square 0.015 --marker 0.011` rather than
the 8 mm / 6 mm default in `pipeline.py` — pass them explicitly.

## Not included

Videos, extracted frames, and `.npy` / `.npz` artefacts are gitignored; a single 4K run is
several GB of JPEGs.
